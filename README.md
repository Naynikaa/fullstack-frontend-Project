# fullstack frontend Project-Career Site for companies

This project is a responsive web-based interface that allows users to browse job listings, apply for positions, and check their application status.
This frontend module focuses on creating an intuitive and visually consistent interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript — forming the foundation for a future full-stack web application.

Features Implemented

Home Page (`index.html`) – Displays the main landing interface with navigation to all sections.
About Page (`about.html`) – Provides an overview of the platform and its purpose.
Jobs Page (`jobs.html`) – Shows available job listings dynamically using JavaScript.
Job Details Page (`job-detail.html`) – Displays detailed information about each job.
Apply Page (`apply.html`) – Allows users to apply for a job (form UI only, no backend yet).
Application Status Page (`application-status.html`) – Displays the user’s application progress (frontend mockup).
Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)– User interface for managing job applications.
Login and Register Pages (`login.html`, `register.html`) – Interactive forms with client-side validation.
Contact Page (`contact.html`) – Lets users reach out via a styled contact form.
Responsive Design (`styles.css`) – Fully styled using CSS for mobile and desktop views.
Interactive Elements (`app.js`)– Adds interactivity, navigation effects, and event handling.

Technologies Used

HTML5 – For page structure and semantic layout
CSS3 – For responsive design and styling
JavaScript  – For interactivity and DOM manipulation

Future Improvements (Backend Integration Plan)

The next phase will include:

* User authentication (login/register with database support)
* Backend server using Node.js 
* Job listings and applications stored in a database (MongoDB or MySQL)
* Real-time status updates for submitted applications
* Admin dashboard for job posting and user management


Would you like me to make this **more customized** — for example, adding your GitHub link, your course name, and your batch (like “GPP 43 FSN – Sri Indu”)?
I can format it like a professional project submission document.
